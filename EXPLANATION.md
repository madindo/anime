# Explanation

## Beginning
After creating new project, I focused on working api and make listing, detail and search work.
Then moving making new components that can be moved from the main page.

## Env & test unit
I had to unused this because I couldn't make process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL work in the testing environment.
For the sake of having a unit test, I had to not use .env for the time being.
