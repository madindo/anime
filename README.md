# Amarthanime

Congratulations on successfully cloning Amarthanime! This README will guide you through setting up your development environment and exploring the project structure.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
Before running the project, you need to install the dependencies. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory, then run:
```bash
// if you're using npm
npm install
// if you're using yarn
yarn install
```

### Step 2: Start the Development Server

```bash
// if you're using npm
npm run dev
// if you're using yarn
yarn dev
```
This command will start the Next.js development server, and your application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

## Project Structure
The project structure follows the standard conventions of a Next.js application. Here's a brief overview:

- **pages/** : Contains the pages of your application. Each file in this directory corresponds to a route in your application.

- **public/** : Stores static assets like images, fonts, and favicons.

- **components/**: Houses reusable React components used throughout your application.

- **lib/**: Includes utility functions, API handlers, or any other logic that doesn't belong to a specific component.

Feel free to explore and modify these files to fit your project's requirements!
